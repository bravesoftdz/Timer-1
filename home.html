Answers:

1.Why positon fixed ?
Because I wanted to handle it one place, even when i change the size of window. Except that sth breaks when i remove that line

2.Try to use !== 
This sign means that value and type is checked

Questions:

1.You should never style by id.
 Why ? I saw examples with id. I thought that you should use id when you are sure that sth will be used only once on site.
 When Im gonna use time with class then its value doesnt change(error)

 2.Avoid 1000 next to setInterval
 Why ? 1000 is one second, I saw that function on stack

 3.Better use classes than manage colors with js ..
 I don't understand if you mean classess in css. I will stil have to somehow call it in js .
